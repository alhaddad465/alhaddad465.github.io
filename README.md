## My name is Al Haddad, a graduating senior in CU Computer Science. Over my time here at CU Boulder, I have worked hard and tried a plethora of different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, Quantum Computing and Data Science. I am fiercely interested in any company that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge, or improves the quality of life of others. The best way to reach me is at my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-haddad/ (add a note where you found me!)
